this bot is developed without using chess lib.

it has a functional gui,with 3 default bot difficulties based on calculation depth, can be changed manually.

the move instruction is in this form: xy such as y the destination square and x is where it came from (e.g e3f3 ).

the first bot moves are pre-coded book moves, so expect a fast response in the first like 3 moves.

you can only as white as of now.

the code is not complete so there is no castling nor en passant.
